In this Project, I've built a Chrome Extension of a Crypto Wallet using which the user can perform numerous operations similar to any other Crypto Wallet. The user can store their NFTs, Crypto Tokens, and even Transfer & Exchange funds. The Wallet's name is Salford and is built using Moralis API. So, just use it and have fun!

Use the `README.md` to get started.
